# LinearRegressionStock

This is a simple model designed to assess the correlations between the excess stock return and various financial factors. The dataset provided can be found on the dataset file. However, the purpose of this project is to test out the code in an isolated environment where I assumed that the stock environment is isolated from human factors. This project refers to the FF5 model as a benchmark for comparisons and tries to exploit factors that are not in the FF5 models.
